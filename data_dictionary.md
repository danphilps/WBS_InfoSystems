## Data Dictionary

Note that these dataitems are perturbed in the data provided, giving you a very good impression of distributions and relationships but not the underlying numbers for each of the features.

Many of these data items are hand selected and make up a small subset of critical attributes of companies to assess based on fundamentals (financials). A solid understanding of financial reporting is needed before you should use these input series, because calculations can vary across different accounting regimes and, frankly, companies can cheat and lie about themselves. Domain knowledge is ALL IMPORTANT. Short cuts are not advised! And don't even think about throwing a load of data into a model unless you fully understand each and every item.
